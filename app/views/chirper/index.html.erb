		<p><strong>Chirper</strong> is a birding application that
		allows you to search, locate, view and record 
		information of North American birds.</p>

		<p>It is the first application facilitating direct submission 
		of user observed bird data to <strong>eBird</strong>. It shows you the nearby 
		birds, helps you to identify birds by providing detailed 
		information, and allows you to record and store on-field bird 
		observations which can later be sent to your accounts through email.</p>
